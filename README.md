# Tips and tricks

* To record a lap time, you must hit the checkpoints (white lines) in order: 1) checkered line, 2) blue turn checkpoint, 3) red turn checkpoint, and 4) yellow turn checkpoint.
* The green car is the only car with a max velocity.
* Master the standard cars (green, blue, red) before the special cars (yellow, cyan, magenta).
* Use a controller instead of a keyboard for smoother driving.
* Try left and right sticks to see which is easier to control.
  * As a right-handed person, I found using the right stick easier than the left stick.
* Check out the cars' stats by reading [`Garage.json`](TriangleTT/Assets/StreamingAssets/Garage.json).
* You can modify the cars' stats by editing the `Garage.json` in your build folder.

# Misc

Before committing, do the following:
* Run the game in the editor player.
* Run the exported game by clicking "File/Build and Run" or Ctrl+B.
  * The export build process might change some non-gitignored files. These changes are build artifacts that are mixed in with non-build-artifact files. This is a known issue. However, these changes should still be committed.
